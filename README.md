# Steam Proton Checker

This uses my GoLang SteamAPI to check every game on your steam library to see the ProtonDB rating of it.<br>
Now ProtonDB already has something like this but I decided to make my own.<br>
<br>
Mine also allows you to see OTHER people's steam libraries ratings without problem
<br>
### Installation
<br>

This will generate an empty file called `apikey` Please save your api key from `https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey` into that file
<br>

### CAUTION
The ratings are not very accurate, they are currently getting a very old report from a long time ago, I may come back to this and update that. But that is the current state of it.
